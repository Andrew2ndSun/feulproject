 	 <h1>OUR VALUES</h1>
 	 <h3>Our values are the foundation upon which our Company was built and upon which we will sustain our success. They are a reflection of our ideals as individuals, and direct our actions as a company. Importantly, these values enable us to foster trust with our employees, our shareholders, our landowners and the communities in which we operate.</h3>

 	 <h3>The safety of our employees, contractors and communities is of utmost importance – this is not negotiable. We recognize that we earn the right to operate every day by developing our assets responsibly and with respect for the environment. We focus on safety and protection of the environment in every operation, and all Callon representatives are authorized to “stop work” if these are at risk.
